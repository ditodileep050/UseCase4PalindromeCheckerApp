# UseCase4 – Character Array Based Palindrome Check

## 🧠 Objective
This use case validates whether a string is a palindrome by converting it into a character array and using the two-pointer technique.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Convert string to character array and compare characters efficiently.

---

## 🔄 Flow

1. Convert string to char[]
2. Initialize two pointers (start & end)
3. Compare characters from both ends
4. Display result

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Used

- Character Array (char[])
- Array Indexing
- Two-Pointer Technique
- Time Complexity Awareness
- Boolean Flag
- Console Output

---

## 🛠 Data Structure Used
char[]

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
javac UseCase4PalindromeCheckerApp.java
java UseCase4PalindromeCheckerApp
```

---

## 📌 Example

Input:
```
radar
```

Output:
```
Is Palindrome?: true
```

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

- Efficient character comparison
- Reduced memory usage
- Understanding pointer-based logic
